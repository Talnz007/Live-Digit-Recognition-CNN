# Live Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. The system captures live video from a webcam and predicts handwritten digits in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time digit recognition:** Uses CNN to predict digits from live webcam feed.
- **Preprocessing:** Converts images to grayscale, resizes, and normalizes for model compatibility.
- **Live video capture:** Captures and processes video frames from a webcam.
- **Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model for digit recognition.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Talnz007/Live-Digit-Recognition.git
   cd Live-Digit-Recognition
   
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install the required packages:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

    Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
    Run the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Live_Digit_Recognition.ipynb
